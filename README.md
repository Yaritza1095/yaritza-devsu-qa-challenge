##Lessons learned:

In these challenges I had the opportunity to show my skills with selenium in regards to handling buttons, textfields, sending data, navigating across different pages, waiting for the page to load, 
for api testing I showcased my abilities with REST assured and TestNG doing a few common api operations like get and post.
